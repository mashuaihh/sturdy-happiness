FOUR
The Invisible Hands
Who’s Rich and How They Got That Way
Every year, Forbes magazine prints a list of the four hundred richest humans in the United States. This issue is as popular with the business crowd as the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is with the sports crowd. It makes for interesting reading, because it tells you who these people are and what made them so rich, and also how the country has changed over the years.
When Forbes first published its list in 1982, the number-one spot was held by Donald K. Ludwig, the shipping tycoon, followed by J. Paul Getty, who got his money the old-fashioned way: inheritance. Five of the top ten were in the Hunt family that drilled Texas full of holes and hit a lot of gushers, which reminds us of the saying attributed to billionaire J. Paul Getty, that the way to get ahead in the world: Rise early, work hard, strike oil.
This original list from fourteen years ago is crawling with Rockefellers and du Ponts, a Frick, a Whitney, a Mellon or two—all great family fortunes that stretch back to the nineteenth century. The word “inheritance” appears in the biographical blurbs no fewer than sixty-five times, and in addition to the sixty-five heirs there are at least twelve sons and daughters who hold positions of influence in family enterprises: a Mars from Mars candy bars, a Disney, a Busch of the beer Busches, a Johnson of Johnson & Johnson.
There weren’t as many old-money fortunes on the 1993 list as there were in the 1980s, which leads to a couple of conclusions about wealth in America. First, it’s not easy to hold on to money, even among billionaires. Inheritance taxes put a big dent in any large fortune that’s handed down from one generation to the next. Unless the heirs are careful and invest wisely, they can lose their millions as fast as their ancestors made them.
Second, America is still the land of opportunity where smart young people like Bill Gates of Microsoft can end up on the Forbes list ahead of the Rockefellers, Mellons, Gettys, and Carnegies.
Just ahead of Gates on the 1993 list is Warren Buffett, who made his $10 billion doing what you’re interested in doing (or you wouldn’t have gotten this far in the book)—picking stocks. Buffett is the first stockpicker in history to reach the top.
Buffett follows a simple strategy: no tricks, no gimmicks, no playing the market, just buying shares in good companies and holding on to them until it gets very boring. The results are far from boring: $10,000 invested with Buffett when he began his career forty years ago would be worth $80 million today. Most of the gains come from stocks in companies you’ve heard of and could buy for yourself, such as Coca-Cola, Gillette, and the Washington Post. If you ever begin to doubt that owning stocks is a smart thing to do, take another look at Buffett’s record.
If you count the du Ponts as one person, only forty-three of the four hundred people on the 1993 Forbes list got there through inheritance. We’re seeing fewer sons and daughters of yesterday’s tycoons and more Horatio Algers, who came out of modest backgrounds and rose to the top on pluck, luck, and a great idea. Harry Helmsley, husband of Leona and owner of multiple hotels, began his business career as a clerk in the mailroom of a real-estate office; David Geffen, the music magnate, worked in the mailroom of the William Morris agency; Ray Kroc, the man who put McDonald’s on the map, was a traveling salesman for milk-mixing machines; Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, started out as a trainee at J. C. Penney; H. Ross Perot was an IBM salesman; and Curtis Leroy Carlson, the trading-stamp king and the son of a Swedish immigrant grocer, subcontracted his paper route to his brothers for a small profit, sold soap for Procter & Gamble, making $110 a month, then started the Gold Bond Trading Stamp Company with a fifty-dollar loan.
A surprising number of dropouts have made it into the top four hundred, beginning with Gates, the Microsoft whiz kid who left Harvard to tinker with software and invented the operating brain that is installed in most of the world’s personal computers.
Then there are Kirk Kerkorian, son of an Armenian immigrant fruit farmer, and a junior-high-school dropout; Les Wexner, founder of the Limited stores, a law school dropout; Geffen, the record producer mentioned above, a college dropout; Paul Allen, cofounder of Microsoft with Gates, a dropout from Washington State; Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting, booted from Brown but later went back to graduate; Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle computers, a University of Illinois dropout; David Howard Murdock, who made his fortune in real estate and corporate takeovers, a traveling salesman’s son and a high-school dropout; John Richard Simplot, who sold McDonald’s the potatoes for their French fries, left home and quit school after the eighth grade to take a job sorting potatoes and raising hogs; Harry Wayne Huizenga, yet another college dropout, who started a trash hauling business with a beat-up old truck and by the age of thirty-one had built it into the world’s largest trash disposal company, Waste Management, before he turned his attention to a Dallas video store, which he built into Blockbuster Video.
Don’t drop out of school because these people did. When they got started in business, it was still possible to get a decent job without a college education—today it’s nearly impossible. Also, every one of them had mastered the basic skills they needed to succeed in business. They didn’t drop out to avoid work, they dropped out to start a company or pursue an interest.
There’s no end to the ways you can make a billion these days: auto parts, the single-handled faucet, the yellow pages, coffee creamer, plastic cups, retread tires, plastics from industrial waste, Slim-Fast, Ping Golf Clubs, high-risk auto insurance, duty-free shops, Carnival Cruises, pizza franchises (Domino’s and Little Caesar), and rental car agencies (Enterprise). There’s even a lawyer on the list, who made his bundle from “sore back cases.”
Several of these billion-dollar ideas were hatched in basements, garages, and small-town storefronts, and grown on shoestring budgets. Hewlett-Packard, the computer giant, came out of $538 worth of electronic parts in David Packard’s garage; Wal-Mart came out of a five-and-dime store in Newport, Arkansas, which lost its lease and later was reopened in Bentonville; Amway Corp. started in a basement where Richard Marvin De Vos and Jay Van Andel made biodegradable soap with a formula they bought from a Detroit chemist.
Only thirty-one in this well-heeled group made their fortunes in real estate, and eighteen from oil, so Getty’s statement no longer rings as true as it once did. A couple of these multimillionaires (Charles Schwab, for one) got there by starting brokerage firms and mutual fund companies; another thirty or so have prospered in the cable and media industry, and at least twenty are involved in electronics and computers.
The biggest change between 1982 and the present is the size of the four hundred biggest fortunes. Back then, you could make the list with $100 million. Now it takes at least $300 million just to bring up the rear. On the top end, there are twenty-five people whose net worth exceeds $2 billion, whereas in 1982, there were only five.
It may be that, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, the rich “are different from you and me,” but you couldn’t prove it by the Forbes list. It turns out there are all kinds of rich people: short, fat, tall, skinny, good-looking, homely, high IQ, not-so-high IQ, big spenders, penny-pinchers, tight-fisted, and generous. It’s amazing how many people keep up their frugal old habits after they’ve made it big. Sam Walton, the Wal-Mart billionaire, who died a couple of years ago, could have bought a fleet of limousines out of his pocket change, but instead, he continued to drive around in a beat-up Chevy with dog teeth marks on the steering wheel. He could have moved to Paris, London, Rome, and other places where they film episodes of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, but he stayed with his wife in his two-bedroom house in their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas.
Warren Buffett is another person who hasn’t let financial success come between him and his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and who still enjoys the simple pleasures of a good book and a bridge game. Gordon Earle Moore, a founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and a cofounder of Intel, arrives at the office in his old pickup every day. There are many such stories of self-made millionaires and billionaires living modestly, avoiding publicity, and working long hours even though they can pay the bills without lifting a finger. “Lives quietly” and “avoids press” are phrases that appear frequently in the descriptions of the Forbes four hundred.
These people are still doing whatever it was that led to their successes. There is a good lesson in this. Find something you enjoy doing and give it everything you’ve got, and the money will take care of itself. Eventually, you reach the point where you can afford to spend the rest of your life at the side of a swimming pool with a drink in your hand, but you probably won’t. You’ll be having too much fun at the office to stop working.
How Coke Got Started
God didn’t look down one day and say, “Let there be Coca-Cola.” The Creator had nothing to do with this, unless you figure He had Coke in mind when he created Dr. John Styth Pemberton. Pemberton went to Atlanta from Columbus, Georgia, in 1869 and went into the patent medicine business as soon as he was old enough to wow an audience.
This was before we had truth in advertising and a Food and Drug Administration to watch over products that people ate or drank. So there was nothing to stop Pemberton from mixing a bunch of ingredients (the main one being alcohol) in the family bathtub, scooping the potion into bottles, and selling it as a miracle cure, which is what patent medicine was all about.
Pemberton’s product line included Indian Queen Hair Dye, Gingerine, Triplex Liver Pills, and an exotic concoction made of sugar, water, extract of coca leaf, kola nut, and caffeine. The label said it was a “brain tonic and a cure for all nervous afflictions,” and in his sales pitches, Pemberton claimed it could cure headaches, hysteria, and melancholy, and put the customer in a very fine mood. This was the original Coca-Cola.
Pemberton spent $73.96 on advertising in the first year, but he sold only fifty dollars’ worth of Coke syrup, so consumers weren’t exactly buying his story. Five years later, they still weren’t buying it, and Pemberton was tired of trying to convince them. So he sold the recipe, the equipment, the coca leaves, and the kola nuts to an Atlanta druggist, Asa Candler. Candler paid twenty-three hundred dollars for the whole shebang.
Candler was a religious man who preferred telling the truth to stretching it the way Pemberton had. He took the coca leaves out of the recipe, so by 1905, Coca-Cola was entirely cocaine-free. It’s a good thing he did, because otherwise people could have gone to jail for sipping Coke after cocaine became illegal in 1914. The revamped Coke recipe is the best-kept secret of the century, still guarded in the vaults of the Trust Company of Georgia.
He also changed the label, leaving out the part about Coke being a “brain tonic,” a “cure for nervous afflictions,” and other dubious claims. In 1916, he invented the curvy bottle that most of the world’s population can identify right away as a Coke.
In Candler’s factory, the kola nuts, sugar, water, caffeine—plus a few secret ingredients of his own—were boiled in giant kettles and stirred with giant wooden paddles until they thickened into a syrup. The syrup was sent out to drugstores, where druggists added soda water for the fizz and served Cokes to people sitting at the counters. Drinking Coke got so popular that druggists had to hire helpers, called “soda jerks,” to pour the syrup and apply the fizz. That’s how thousands of teenagers across the country got their spending money—working after school pouring Cokes.
In 1916, Congress slapped a new tax on businesses, and Candler was furious. To avoid paying higher taxes on his Coke profits, he sold the company for $25 million to an Atlanta banker, Ernest Woodruff. His son, Robert, became Coca-Cola’s president.
Soon after they bought the company, the Woodruffs went public with it. In 1919, they sold 1 million shares for forty dollars apiece. This was a stock a lot of people wished they didn’t own, especially after the cost of syrup went through the roof. Angry bottlers protested the price hikes and threatened to cancel their contracts with the company. Lawsuits were filed. Coke’s sales went down, and the company wobbled on the edge of bankruptcy.
Thanks to Robert Woodruff’s serious cost-cutting, Coke managed to survive long enough to reach the Great Depression. This was a terrible time for most companies, but a good time for Coke. Even though people had very little money to spend, and went without new shoes, new clothes, and so on, they kept buying Cokes.
Here’s a useful piece of advice for investors: Act like a bloodhound and ignore everything except the evidence that shows up in front of your nose. The economy in the 1930s couldn’t have been worse, but since Coke was very profitable, the stock price rose from $20 in 1932 to $160 in 1937. Imagine making eight times your money when everyone around you was predicting the end of the world.
Robert Woodruff ran Coke for thirty years, dodging reporters, trying to keep his name out of the papers. He had several houses and at least one big ranch, but other than that, he spent modestly for a multimillionaire. Apparently, he never read books and rarely listened to music or looked at a painting, unless it had a duck or a deer in it. He gave parties, but only because he had to.
Just as Coke had benefited from one calamity, the Great Depression, it benefited from another calamity, World War II. People around the world saw the GIs drinking Coke, and they decided to imitate their heroes by doing the same. The GIs were the most effective unpaid sponsors in the history of commercial advertising.
It was after the war that Coke became the first truly multinational company. Coke’s snazzy red billboards were seen on walls and buildings on six continents—sometimes, they were used to cover holes in the buildings. Coke became a symbol of the American way of life, which is why the communists in Russia hated it. (In the 1970s, the Russian leaders signed a contract with Pepsi!) Our missiles were aimed at the Russians, and their missiles were aimed at us, and they worried about the fallout from a soft drink. Even in France, the Communist party tried to ban Coke.
To get the full benefit from owning Coke stock, you had to be patient for two decades, until 1958, when the price took another flying leap. Five thousand dollars’ worth of Coke shares in 1958 was worth nearly $100,000 by 1972. There aren’t many chances in life to turn $5,000 into $100,000 in fourteen years, unless you win the lottery or do something illegal.
In the crash of 1972, Coke suffered along with all the other stocks, dropping a quick 63 percent and not gaining it back for three years, until 1985. But once again, patience was rewarded when the stock price took another flying leap and Coke turned $5,000 into $50,000 from 1984 to 1994.
In a fight between communism and Coca-Cola, Coke won hands down, because while the communists have gone out of business, Coke is still going strong. As it turns out, its biggest threat didn’t come from the Russians. It came from Pepsi.
To think that Coke could have bought Pepsi for next to nothing in the 1930s, when Pepsi wobbled on the edge of bankruptcy. But it didn’t happen, and Pepsi came back to haunt Coke fifty years later. In 1984, Pepsi was outselling Coke in the U.S. market, and the brains at Coke headquarters were forced to launch a counterattack. In the heat of battle, they invented diet Coke, which changed the soft-drink industry and took millions of excess pounds off the waistlines of the human race. Without the pressure of Pepsi’s competition, Coke might never have thought of diet Coke.
The Woodruff era ended in the mid-1950s, when Robert Woodruff went into retirement, when he passed the time giving away his money. He donated hundreds of millions to medicine, the arts, and Emory University, and he gave the land on which the Center for Disease Control and Prevention was built in Atlanta. He opened his wallet to the Atlanta Art Center Alliance, even though he never liked going to museums and symphonies. Many of his gifts were anonymous, but people figured out Woodruff was responsible—who else in Atlanta was that rich and that bighearted? They started calling him “Mr. Anonymous.”
Roberto Goizueta took over the reins at Coke in 1981, and serves as chairman to this day. He and Don Keough, Coke’s former president, made a fabulous team. They have pushed international sales to the point that people in 195 countries are drinking Cokes the way they once drank water. Given the sorry condition of the world’s water supply, they may be better off drinking Cokes than drinking water.
Goizueta is a story in himself. He comes from a wealthy farming family in Cuba that lost its property in the Castro revolution. He worked for Coke in Cuba, then transferred to a Coke office in the Bahamas after Castro took power. From there, he moved to Coke headquarters in Atlanta, where he worked his way up the corporate ladder.
There’s no end in sight for Coke’s popularity worldwide, but it’s taken Wall Street a long time to catch on to this. Some “experts” haven’t caught on yet.
How Wrigley’s Got Started
William Wrigley, Jr., left Philadelphia for Chicago in 1891 to become a salesman for his father’s soap company. Besides soap, the company also made baking powder, and to sell the baking powder they gave away free cookbooks as a prize. The baking powder got so popular they decided to forget about the soap.
At some point, they stopped giving away cookbooks and offered chewing gum as a prize. The chewing gum got so popular they dropped the baking powder and began to sell gum.
Wrigley’s spearmint made its debut in 1893, but like Coke, it wasn’t an instant hit. However, by 1910, it was America’s favorite brand. In 1915, to boost sales even further, Wrigley sent a free sample to every person listed in all the phone books in the United States.
Campbell’s Soup
Dr. John T. Dorrance, a chemistry buff, turned down offers of a professorship at four different universities to take a job at a soup company owned by his uncle, Arthur Dorrance, and by Joseph Campbell. Once installed there, Dr. Dorrance invented a process for making condensed soup, then bought out his uncle to become sole owner of the business. This was a mistake on his uncle’s part, because Campbell’s continued to grow its earnings and became the $11.4 billion company it is today.
An enthusiastic stockpicker in his spare time, Dr. Dorrance took his broker’s advice and sold all his stocks before the Crash of 1929. This was the best advice ever given by a broker, before or since.
Levi’s
Levi Strauss was an immigrant from a part of Germany known as Bavaria. He made pants out of tent canvas and sold them to the prospectors who came to California to get rich in the Gold Rush of 1849. While most of the prospectors went home empty-handed, Strauss got rich on his blue jeans. He took out a patent on the denim version in 1873.
Strauss’s company was private until 1971, when it sold shares to the public, then bought back the shares and in 1985 went private again.
Levi’s, Campbell’s soup, Wrigley’s gum, and Coca-Cola got started one hundred or more years ago, when life wasn’t as complicated as it is today and there weren’t so many lawyers getting in the way of progress. But that doesn’t mean you can’t start a great business from scratch in the modern era. Ben and Jerry, Bill Gates, and Bernard Marcus have done it with ice cream, software, and hardware stores.
How Ben & Jerry’s Got Started
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield met in seventh-grade gym class on Long Island, and a few years later, they became hippies. Ben dropped out of college, then drove a taxi, flipped hamburgers, mopped floors, guarded a racetrack, and took up pottery. He once lived in a cabin in the Adirondacks with a woodstove and no plumbing. He had a big beard and a belly to match.
Meanwhile, Jerry went to Oberlin College in Ohio, where in addition to his regular studies he learned parlor tricks and how to run carnival games. He applied to medical school, got rejected, then took a job stuffing beef hearts into test tubes. He was skinnier than Ben, and he adopted the grunge look long before it was fashionable.
The two of them crossed paths again in Saratoga Springs, New York, and decided since they had nothing better to do, why not start an ice cream restaurant? Jerry spent five dollars for a mail-order course on how to make the ice cream. With six thousand dollars they’d saved, plus two thousand dollars they borrowed from Ben’s father, they patched the roof of an old gas station in Burlington, Vermont, threw a coat of paint on the walls, and renamed it the Scoop Shop. That was 1978.
The people who came to the Scoop Shop couldn’t get enough of Ben and Jerry’s scoops. Their ice cream was rich and creamy, and full of big chunks of fruit, or chocolate, or whatever they put into it. It was high-fat and high-cholesterol, but in 1978, people didn’t care about cholesterol, so they could eat large quantities of Ben & Jerry’s without feeling guilty.
Soon enough, Ben and Jerry were selling so much ice cream they outgrew the gas station. They decided to build an ice cream factory. They could have gone to venture capitalists to get the money, but instead, they went straight to the stock market. In 1984, they sold 73,500 shares of stock at $10.50 apiece and raised roughly three quarters of a million dollars. This was peanuts as far as big business went, but that’s all they needed for the factory.
To make sure the company was locally owned, they made it a rule that only residents of Vermont could buy shares in the initial offering. Vermont is not a wealthy state to begin with, so many investors bought one share apiece—this was all they could afford. Ten years later, the stock was worth ten times the original price.
Ben & Jerry’s is one of the most interesting public companies on record. The bosses came to work in tee shirts and bib overalls and never wore suits—they didn’t own any suits. They named one of their flavors Cherry Garcia, in honor of Jerry Garcia, the rock star of the Grateful Dead. At the annual meetings, Ben would lie down with a brick on his belly and let Jerry smash the brick with a sledgehammer.
You couldn’t tell the executives from the mop-up crew. The parking lot was full of dented Volkswagens. The higher-ups were paid low salaries by normal standards—the idea was that everybody deserved to make a living, but nobody deserved to make a killing. The narrow salary gap made for friendlier relations between labor and management, and better parties on the weekends.
Ben and Jerry piped rock and roll into the plant, to inspire the staff to dance around and do its best. They showed free outdoor movies in Burlington during the summer. They bought so much milk from local farmers that they revived the entire Vermont dairy industry. They even paid extra for the milk, to help out the farmers. And 7.5 percent of the annual profits went to charity.
Where else but in America could two hippies invest five dollars in a mail-order course and end up as the third-largest ice cream manufacturers in the country? A couple of years ago, the company had its midlife crisis: People had discovered cholesterol, and they stopped eating so much of the rich, creamy ice cream that was Ben & Jerry’s claim to fame.
The company has changed with the times, and now it puts out a line of yogurt and low-fat substitutes for the creamy stuff their customers once craved.
In 1994, Ben stepped down as chief executive officer, although he was never as much a chief executive as he was a chief ice cream taster. The company had a contest to find Ben’s replacement. To win the job, you had to send in something interesting, besides the usual résumé. The man who got the job wrote a poem.
Microsoft
Bill Gates is William Henry Gates III, born in 1955. He grew up in the suburbs of Bellevue, Washington, and attended the nearby Lakeside School. Lakeside had a computer lab, which was very unusual in the 1960s, and Gates took full advantage of it.
Gates was entranced, captivated, smitten with computers. He spent as much time as possible in the lab with his friend and sidekick Paul Allen, who was a couple of years ahead of him in school. Computers got to be such an obsession with Gates that his parents issued an order: Give them up for a while. Reluctantly, Gates complied, but this absence only made his heart grow fonder.
Soon enough, Gates and Allen were up to their old tricks, experimenting with the primitive hardware and software that existed then. There were no instruction manuals or DOS for Dummies books to guide them—Gates and Allen invented DOS. They were the pioneers of software, while hundreds of miles to the south, the two Steves, Jobs and Wozniak, were creating the Apple.
Scientists and engineers in fancy research labs couldn’t accomplish what these young “hackers” in blue jeans and tee shirts accomplished by themselves. Before they left high school, Gates and Allen had become experts in the exciting new field of computer programming.
Gates went on to Harvard, thinking he would become a lawyer, while Allen got a job with a small computer company in New Mexico, called MITS. Dividing his time between the classroom, the poker table, and the computer room, Gates was soon bored with college life. When he couldn’t stand it any longer, he dropped out of Harvard to join his old friend in New Mexico. The two of them had already invented a new computer language called BASIC.
MITS had hired Allen to create a version of BASIC for a computer chip made by Intel. But BASIC made such a big splash that several other computer makers wanted to use it as the operating system for their machines. This led to a nasty lawsuit over who had the rights to BASIC: Gates and Allen, or MITS? The courts ruled in favor of the inventors, because they’d developed BASIC before they got to MITS. Now, they were free to sell the language and keep the profits for themselves.
Gates started his own company, Microsoft, even before he escaped the clutches of MITS. After the lawsuit was resolved, he put all his energy into Microsoft. The company was informal and disorganized, and the employees worked crazy hours. Computers were scattered around the office, but the books were kept by hand. Visitors would peek into the boss’s office and ask: “Who’s that kid sitting at Mr. Gates’s desk?” That kid was Gates himself. He was twenty-five, and he looked even younger.
One triumph led to another, and in 1980, this tiny company found itself in serious negotiations with the computer giant IBM. IBM had developed a new line of personal computers, and it needed a software system to go with it. Gates went to a meeting, impressed the IBM executives, and got the assignment of a lifetime. Working day and night and in secrecy, under contract with IBM, Gates and his cohorts created MS-DOS.
People have tried and failed to create a universal language for humans, but Microsoft has come close to doing it for computers—MS-DOS is currently spoken by 75 percent of the personal computers on the planet.
If IBM had been smart enough to demand some of the rights to MS-DOS, its shares would be selling for a much higher price. Instead, IBM let Microsoft retain all the rights, which is why Microsoft has become a billion-dollar company in its own right. The moral to this story is: If you are about to make somebody very rich, insist on a piece of the action.
Home Depot
Home Depot got its start when three executives at the Handy Dan Home Center stores got the boot. Convinced they could do a better job than the people who fired them, this trio of rejects decided to open their own version of Handy Dan. Handy Dan has disappeared from the scene, but Home Depot is everywhere.
This decision was only a prelude to serious business for the organizers of Home Depot. They convinced a venture capital group to put up the money to build the first super hardware store, in Atlanta. The grand opening was a flop. The ad promised a free dollar to every person who walked through the door. The crowd was so small that at the end of the day, there was a pile of cash left over. At that point, people wouldn’t go to Home Depot even if you paid them.
But it wasn’t long before customers were flocking to Home Depot, attracted by the huge selection of merchandise, the low prices, and the well-trained clerks who could answer questions about everything from floorboards to floodlights. It was such a popular store that it continued to ring up sales in a recession, when most retailers were hurting. In fact, when the recession forced J. C. Penney out of four shopping centers around Atlanta, Home Depot took over the leases and opened four more stores.
Once they saw they had a winner, the organizers planned a rapid expansion. They went to the stock market to raise the money. In 1981, Home Depot sold its first shares to the public, at twelve dollars apiece. Today those same shares (adjusted for splits) are worth $3,308 apiece!
By 1984, Home Depot had nineteen stores. In 1985, the company stumbled a bit when profits fell. It had made the common mistake of trying to expand too fast. In 1986, it sold more stock and used the proceeds to pay some of its debts. Three years later, it became the largest home-repair chain in the country. In 1995, Home Depot had more than 365 stores and sold more than $14 billion worth of hardware.
It’s Not Over Yet
In spite of everything you hear about the United States getting weak in the knees and long in the tooth and old in the hat and losing its place in the world, we are leading the world in new ideas. We’re number one in music, television, and movies; the low-cost producers in forest products, paper, aluminum, and chemicals. Wall Street is still the financial capital for stocks, and we’re gaining back our prominence in banking, as the Japanese banks are beset with problems.
Believe it or not, our railroads are so good at moving cargo that other countries are studying how we do it. Our freight system is the envy of freight haulers everywhere. (Our passenger system leaves a lot to be desired.)
We’re tops in cellular phones, electronic test equipment, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, and farm equipment. We excel at genetic engineering, semiconductors, and medical advances. After years of decline, our share of the export market is rising. That means that consumers in other countries are buying more of what we make.
We ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne, Spandex to Siena, and bike parts to Bombay. Men on six continents shave their whiskers with Gillette. The skies are filled with Boeing’s aircraft. Japan is supposed to be the master of electronics—memory chips, TVs, and fax machines—but the Japanese can’t keep up with the brainstorms coming out of such U.S. companies as Intel, Micron Technology, Microsoft, and Compaq Computer.
We’re number one in personal computers. In software, work stations, laser printers, computer networks, and microprocessors, we dominate the field.
Many of our most fantastic innovations emerge from small companies. We lead the world in small companies as well. We’ve already seen how a bunch of kids at Microsoft and Apple Computer changed the computer industry forever. Twenty years later, there is a bunch of kids in software labs giving a repeat performance.
It wasn’t long ago that we were scolded by our own newspapers and news magazines for being fat, lazy, and overpaid. We have a free press and the press likes to focus on warts and not halos, because warts sell more papers than halos do.
So we heard over and over that the Japanese people worked harder than we did and the German people worked harder than we did, and while we were sitting around channel surfing or goofing off in school or playing with Frisbees (another great American invention), these other countries would be passing us by.
It was inevitable, the doomsayers said, that America would become a land of do-nothings and make-nothings, except maybe we’d still be smart enough to make those little paper umbrellas they stick into cocktails.
The auto industry was the most obvious trouble spot. Before the 1960s, we were first in war, first in peace, and first in cars, and Detroit was the car lover’s Mecca. But after that, our auto companies got sloppy and let the factories run down. Through their powerful unions, the workers demanded higher and higher wages. At this point, the Japanese and the Germans attacked Detroit with their spiffy, well-made, low-priced cars. Millions of U.S. consumers preferred these foreign models to the humdrum, poorly made, overpriced American cars.
Journalists and academics wrote articles and books about the decline and fall of U.S. autos, which they saw as a symptom of the decline and fall of the American way of life. The most influential of these books was David Halberstam’s The Reckoning.
You could read Halberstam’s work and weep for the future of Ford, of General Motors, of Chrysler, and of America, but the year it was published, 1986, was also the year that Chrysler began its comeback from near bankruptcy and Ford started on a huge rebound, while Nissan and the Japanese automakers were starting to flop. The U.S. losers have become winners again.
Investors who did their homework and saw this happening got very wealthy buying Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors stock. If they bought at the right time, they made fifteen times their money in Chrysler, ten times in Ford, and three times in General Motors.
This wasn’t a one-year improvement, or five years, it was a gigantic long-term trend. Just as it took years for Detroit to lose its place at the top of the auto industry, it took years for the comeback. This comeback totally surprised a lot of people, but that’s because we weren’t getting the real story. We were hearing the old news, about how the auto industry was controlled by the Japanese. But it wasn’t the Japanese who invented the minivan; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the Japanese who put a new generation of snazzy, low-cost automobiles on the road; it was Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors. It wasn’t Nissan that redesigned the Jeep; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the Toyota that became the best-selling car in Europe, it was the Ford Fiesta.
Here at home, the Japanese have been losing their share of the U.S. market, as the U.S. auto companies are winning it back.
We’ve fixed up our factories and made them more efficient. Our wages have come down, and that has lowered our production costs, so we can sell our goods at lower prices and undercut the foreign competition.
Over the last two decades that we’ve been feeling bad about ourselves, the U.S. labor force has become the most productive in the world. Today, the American industrial worker produces $49,600 worth of goods every year, $5,000 more than the average German and $10,000 more than the average Japanese. We’re putting in more hours and taking fewer vacations than the average German worker, who gets five weeks of paid leave every year.
In fact, the U.S. labor force has been so busy and so productive that a professor at Harvard, Juliet Schor, has written a book called The Overworked American. The press did such a good job convincing us we’ve been goofing off, especially in comparison to the industrious Japanese, that it’s a surprise to discover we’ve been working too hard.
That’s not to say we don’t have our problems. In the last two decades, our economic growth overall has lagged behind the growth rates of prior decades, and wages in the lowest-paying jobs haven’t risen much, if at all. We’ve got high crime and high unemployment in the inner cities, where as many as half the children never finish high school. Without an education, these people can’t possibly compete for all the wonderful jobs that have been created by computers and advanced technology.
As bad as our problems may be, they don’t add up to the pessimism that infects us. We got a similar dose of pessimism in the late 1940s, after the war was over and 10 million to 20 million Americans lost their war-related jobs in the military or the defense industries. More than a third of the workforce had to find work elsewhere, a crisis that far exceeded any layoff crisis we face today, and yet today’s headlines would make you think we’re in worse shape now than what we were in after World War II.
In fact, the 1950s was a good decade for the economy and a great one for stocks—second only to the 1980s in this century. So people’s pessimism and their low expectations for the future turned out to be misplaced, just as they’re turning out to be misplaced in the first half of the 1990s.
Heroes
In school, we debate whether Hamlet is a hero or a wimp, or whether King Lear was stupid or a victim of a greedy daughter, or Napoleon was a great general or a land-grabbing tyrant. But we never debate whether Sam Walton is a villain or a hero. Sam Walton got rich by starting Wal-Mart: Was this a good thing or a bad thing? What about Michael Eisner at Disney? Is Eisner a rich pig or a corporate savior?
Joe Montana, who played football, is a national celebrity who is nearly deified for his great contribution to society. No doubt he has contributed. But how does Montana stack up as a hero against Sam Walton or Lee Iacocca at Chrysler? Who, for instance, has created more jobs?
Iacocca never brought an NFL team back from a two-touchdown deficit in the fourth quarter, the way Joe Montana did. But he brought back Chrysler, which was about to go out of business during the crucial quarters in 1981–82. The game was on the line—imagine what would have happened if Iacocca had failed.
Not only would Chrysler’s more than 115,948 workers have been sent home for good, but the tire makers, aluminum and steel suppliers, auto glass suppliers, seat leather suppliers, and so forth, would have been forced to lay off workers in the wake of Chrysler’s demise. By saving Chrysler, Iacocca may have saved more than three hundred thousand paychecks. How many paychecks did Joe Montana save?
By putting fans in the seats, Montana indirectly kept some ticket sellers and hot-dog vendors in business, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But the jobs Iacocca saved weren’t of the hot-dog vendor variety. Many of them were high-skilled positions, paying twenty dollars an hour. Over three hundred thousand well-paid workers can thank Iacocca for their vacations, for their second homes, and for helping to put their kids through college.
Is Jack Welch, the head of General Electric, a more important person than Elton John? Is Dr. Roy Vagelos, who helped Merck develop many innovative drugs to combat diseases, a more important person than Jodie Foster, Princess Diana, or Shaquille O’Neal? If it came to a vote, we’d vote for Welch and Vagelos. And yet the baker in the Dunkin Donut commercials is better known than most of the people on our list.
You’ll notice we often name two heroes—usually the person who got the company started and the person or persons who kept it going. These are the Invisible Hands of the 1990s, and we’re sure they would have impressed Adam Smith back in 1776. Their counterparts in other countries are carrying out capitalist missions around the globe.
We regret to report a shortage of women and minorities in the ranks of our heroes. Only one woman makes the list—Doris Fisher, cofounder of The Gap. We can only hope that as more young people are attracted to careers in business, women and minorities will get their chance to run public companies.
Perhaps after reading this book (it’s a family assignment) the three Lynch daughters, Mary, Annie, and Beth, and the two Rothchild daughters, Berns and Sascha, will be inspired to join the corporate ranks.
The corporate leaders of America aren’t just a gang of moneygrubbers whose main purpose in life is to ride on Learjets to the golf courses of the world. Fred Smith didn’t start Federal Express, also known as FedEx, because he needed the money; Smith was already rich. He did it for the challenge, to create a mail system that works better than the post office. Because Smith succeeded, the post office has shaped up considerably. Now, in addition to delivering mail in the rain, hail, sleet, and snow, the postal service can even deliver it overnight.
Because they end up with big bucks, the people who run companies are often made out to be villains, lumped together with bank robbers and con artists. You’d think they wrote themselves $10-million paychecks and left town with the loot, when in fact, their money doesn’t come from their paychecks. This is a major point that is overlooked by the jeering section.
In most cases, the big corporate fortunes come from owning the company’s stock. The higher up you are on the corporate ladder, the more likely it is that you will be paid in shares instead of cash. Executives are also given “options,” which enable them to buy more shares at a specific price.
But all of this works to the executives’ benefit only if the company does well and the stock price goes up. If the company does poorly and the price goes down, these people stand to lose money and may be worse off than if they earned a huge salary.
Being paid in stock puts a company’s leadership on the same side of the table as the shareholders. When they make big bucks on the stock, other investors also are profiting from the shares they own. It’s a win/win situation.
So instead of booing when Michael Eisner makes $50 million on his Disney shares, we ought to be cheering him on, because it means that Disney is thriving under his leadership, the stock price is rising (up elevenfold in ten years), and investors large and small are reaping the benefits.
That said, we’d be willing to bet that Eisner isn’t just doing it for the money. Like most of his colleagues at the CEO level, he’s already got plenty, yet he still goes to work every day. Why does he bother? He enjoys the challenge of outsmarting the competition. Business demands savvy, strength, and cunning. There may be monotony on the assembly line, but not in the boardroom or the offices upstairs.
In teaching the post office a lesson, Fred Smith created jobs. All the corporate heroes honored in this chapter have created jobs, not that we’ve been hearing much about job creation. Lately, we’ve only been hearing about job losses.
From the news reports of the last couple of years, you’d think there weren’t any jobs left in America. Every time you pick up a paper, you see another headline about a big corporate layoff. A reporter doesn’t have to dig very far to find one of these stories, because the largest five hundred companies in the United States reduced their workforce by 3 million workers in the 1980s, and they’re on a pace to do the same in the 1990s.
A layoff is always painful to the person who loses the job, but that doesn’t make layoffs a national crisis. In the larger scheme of things, these layoffs are healthy.
Companies aren’t Scrooges who wring their hands in glee and shout “Bah Humbug” as they shove loyal employees out the door. In many cases, the layoffs are done by attrition: A person who is about to retire isn’t replaced. But the layoffs have a purpose: to make companies more competitive and better able to survive in the future.
Imagine the catastrophe we’d be facing if those five hundred big companies had kept the 3 million workers they dismissed in the 1980s. Eventually, the bloated payrolls would have destroyed these companies. They couldn’t possibly have been able to compete against their more efficient rivals, which could operate at lower cost and drive them out of business. So instead of the 3 million jobs lost in the big companies, we might have lost 10 million, or 15 million, and the country would have been thrown into another Depression.
That brings us to the twenty-five large companies listed on page 228. There are at least three kinds: companies that have kept growing for decades (Walgreen, McDonald’s, and Raytheon, for instance); companies that had lost their way before the hero arrived to turn them around; and companies that were doing OK but then got a second wind and accomplished amazing things, given that they were getting old and people thought their best years were behind them.
Chrysler is one of the turnarounds, along with Colgate, Allied Signal, Caterpillar, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage), and Citicorp, so we’ve got several different kinds of companies represented here. Then in the “second-wind” category, we’ve got Coca-Cola, which has done the improbable and accelerated its growth rate along with Gillette, Motorola, and Merck.
There are two heroes of the Fannie Mae story, David Maxwell and Jim Johnson. Fannie Mae, formally known as the Federal National Mortgage Association, is the country’s number-one owner and packager of home mortgages. When David Maxwell came along, Fannie Mae was an unstable enterprise—one year in the black, the next in the red, flirting with insolvency. Maxwell straightened Fannie Mae out and put it squarely in the black.
Johnson took over in 1991. Under his direction, Fannie Mae has more than doubled its earnings and made future earnings less volatile and more dependable. While Fannie Mae employs only three thousand people, a tiny payroll for such a big company, it affects millions of homeowners directly and indirectly through its ownership of one out of five mortgages in America.
The fate of large numbers of jobs depends on Fannie Mae’s ability to finance mortgage loans. If this company were poorly managed and got into trouble, we might see a collapse of the new housing market as well as the resale market. Home builders, carpet layers, real-estate agents, insurance agents, bankers, appliance stores, hardware stores, and home-furnishings stores would suffer as a result.
Hewlett-Packard was an old-line technology company that made testing equipment and measuring equipment for the electronics industry. As you can see on the table on page 242, in 1975, it had $981 million in sales; twenty years later, it approaches $30 billion in sales. The testing and measuring part of the company accounts for only 11 percent of the revenues. Seventy-eight percent comes from printers and computers. Hewlett-Packard didn’t make printers fifteen years ago, but it has quietly become the Goliath in the business, selling an estimated $9 billion to $10 billion worth of printers and related products every year. The printers have given Hewlett-Packard a quality brand name that helps it sell computers. In now ranks sixth in personal computer sales worldwide.
Hewlett-Packard has grown to nearly half the size of IBM, but in 1975, it was fifteen times smaller. It grew and prospered because the employees were encouraged to invent new products and to develop new ideas. The hero who aided and abetted this innovation is CEO John Young.
This drive to make companies more competitive can be traced back to 1982. We’d just come through the worst recession since World War II—a tough stretch. The auto industry was hopeless, we had high unemployment, and Americans from coast to coast sensed that the country was losing it.
In this general crisis, corporate leaders made a momentous decision. They decided to change the basic way they approached business. Before 1982, they had stumbled through each economic cycle, adding workers during periods of prosperity, then laying them off during recessions. When business was bad, they cut back in stages, first eliminating the overtime, then giving older workers early retirement, and so forth.
Since 1982, companies of all kinds have dedicated themselves to becoming more efficient overall. On Wall Street, this is known as restructuring, rightsizing, downsizing, or getting leaner and meaner. Whatever you call it, it means reducing costs and boosting productivity, not just to survive recessions, but to become more profitable and more competitive as a matter of course.
Take a company like Johnson & Johnson, with a record of thirty years of nearly uninterrupted increased earnings—under the old system, it wouldn’t have occurred to Johnson & Johnson to make rightsizing a priority. But under the new system, even a healthy company like Johnson & Johnson realized it had to take steps to maintain its edge, while continuing to develop new products.
That’s why we’ve seen this surge in corporate profitability in the last fifteen years, which has produced a surge in stock prices that tops any other period in history. We’re a much wealthier nation than we were in 1982, and much of this prosperity has to do with the change in the way companies do business, including laying off workers to become more competitive. No one has noticed this out in medialand. They still think our corporate leaders are busy playing golf.
Companies are no longer resting on their laurels. They might have record earnings this year, but they are worried about what happens ten years out. They don’t want to go the way of Pan Am, Eastern, and Braniff—three airlines that lost their edge and went out of business. Directly or indirectly, tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs when these airlines disappeared.
Being more competitive isn’t just a matter of handing out the pink slips and turning off some lights to save money. Let’s say a company invests $100 million to build a new plant, where the same workforce from the old plant can increase the output by 15 percent.
This extra 15 percent can help a lot of people. The company can give its employees a 5 percent raise, making the workers happy; it can lower prices by 5 percent, making the customers happy; and it can increase its profits, making the shareholders happy. Of course, this 15 percent could be divided up differently. But the point is there are multiple benefits when a company becomes more competitive.
There’s another way to increase productivity: making better products with fewer mistakes. Fewer mistakes mean fewer complaints from customers, fewer phone calls to apologize for those mistakes, fewer replacement items that have to be shipped out, fewer repairs of defective merchandise. A company that cuts down on its defects from 5 percent to 0.5 percent can save huge amounts of time and money that otherwise would be expended on cleaning up messes and handing irate customers.
In the table beginning on page 236, you’ll find the list of heroes that have turned small companies into big companies. It’s another side of the job story that rarely gets told. You’ve heard about the 3 million jobs lost from the big companies in the 1980s—and more of the same in the 1990s—but have you heard about the 21 million jobs created by small and medium-sized companies in the 1980s? There haven’t been many headlines about that.
Nobody has an exact count of the jobs created by small companies, but we do know that 2.1 million new businesses opened their doors in the 1980s. Some are bigger than others, some have succeeded and some have failed, but if we assume that on average, each small business employs ten people, that’s 21 million new jobs. That’s seven times more jobs than were lost in the well-publicized big layoffs.
Among these 2.1 million businesses was a small group of high achievers that eventually went public. Twenty-five of the most successful have made it to our heroes list. It’s amazing how far they’ve come in a short time. In 1985, the twenty-five added together had sales of $30.8 million, less than half of what Exxon sold by itself. IBM’s earnings in 1985 were four times the combined earnings of all twenty-five.
Back then, these twenty-five companies provided jobs for 358,000 workers, while the large companies on our list provided jobs for more than 2.6 million workers.
Look what’s happened in ten years. While the large companies on our list have lost more than 420,000 jobs over that period, our small companies have turned into giants. In 1995, their combined sales will be $225 billion, and they employ nearly 1.4 million workers, adding 1 million jobs to the workforce.
In 1975, Disney qualified as a small company; today, it is huge. Walt Disney is the superhero of the Disney story; Michael Eisner is the hero. Disney’s great organization had begun to nod off a bit when Eisner prodded it awake. In the old days, Disney would reissue the classic animated films, but until Eisner came along, the company had stopping making new ones. Under Eisner’s regime, the company brought out The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast, among others; became a major producer of feature films; revitalized the existing theme parks and opened new ones; triumphed in the music business with soundtracks that were as popular as its movies; and launched a merchandising campaign that put Disney souvenirs in stores around the world.
Toys R Us was a medium-sized enterprise in 1985, but today it has more sales than Gillette or Colgate and 20,000 more employees than Goodyear Tire. Wal-Mart was the biggest of the small companies in 1985, but today it is bigger than every one of the big companies on our list, except Exxon.

Amgen didn’t exist in 1975, and in 1985 it had less than 200 employees. Today, it manufactures two billion-dollar pharmaceuticals, Neupogen and Epogen. These are important drugs that help patients worldwide and could help Amgen earn more than $300 million in 1995. The heroes there are George B. Rathmann and Gordon Binder.
Then there’s Ross Perot’s creation, Electronic Data Systems, bought by General Motors in 1984. Perot used to work for IBM. He tried to talk IBM into helping companies solve their information-processing problems, but IBM wasn’t particularly interested. So Perot went off on his own and started EDS. It had $100 million in sales in 1975, $3.4 billion in 1985, and in 1995, it will reach $10 billion in sales. Perot has been out of EDS since 1986, but the company has grown dramatically since he left. It’s been a fantastic acquisition for GM.
This shows you the importance of a hero. For at least a couple of decades, IBM didn’t have heroic leadership. This dominant company was caught flatfooted. It lost the information services business to Perot’s EDS, the software business to Microsoft, and the microprocessor business to Intel. It lost its number-one ranking in personal computer sales to Compaq and a big chunk of its mainframe memory business to EMC. All five of these successful competitors to IBM are on our list of small companies that have made it big.
Bill McGowan and Bert Roberts are the heroes at MCI. They dared to compete with AT&T in the long-distance market while people laughed at them for doing it. For ten years, MCI lost money, but it has survived and it has succeeded. Because of MCI’s competition, we all pay less for long-distance calls.
Ken Iverson is the hero at Nucor, a steel company in a hopeless industry. Iverson doesn’t waste money on trifles, so he put Nucor headquarters in a strip mall in Darlington, South Carolina. (It remained there for years.) Nucor started out as a buyer of steel, but soon learned to make its own high-quality steel from scrap, something U.S. Steel never figured out how to do. By the year 2000 Nucor will produce as much steel as U.S. Steel. It will have caught up to the first billion-dollar company in U.S. history.
Tom Stemberg is the hero at Staples. He once wrote a business plan for an office superstore. Nobody paid much attention to it except Stemberg himself. He put it into practice with the first superstore in Brighton, Massachusetts. That was just about ten years ago. Today, office superstores are on the verge of becoming a $10-billion industry, and at the current growth rate, they will be a $20-billion industry by the year 2000.
A pair of brothers makes the heroes list. They left home in opposite directions. Jim Burke went the large-company route and ended up in the chairman’s chair at Johnson & Johnson, while Dan Burke went the small-company route and joined a tiny communications outfit that became the hugely successful Capital Cities/ABC, which recently agreed to a merger with Disney.
The nation’s prosperity depends on small companies getting bigger and big companies getting more competitive. If, while our twenty-five small companies were coming along, the twenty-five old-timers on our list had fallen apart, the net result would have been zero job growth, or possibly a huge loss in jobs.
Imagine the disaster if dozens of the Fortune 500 companies had gone bankrupt instead of downsizing and rightsizing. In that case, we might have lost 15 million jobs in the last decade, and today we’d have 20 percent unemployment in spite of the 21 million jobs created by small companies nationwide.
Don’t think it couldn’t have happened. It could have happened if companies had decided to keep every last worker and throw productivity out the window, and to hang on until foreign rivals put them out of business. It could have happened if our heroes hadn’t come along to inspire their colleagues to a maximum effort.
In the United States, we’re fortunate to have such an excellent mix of small companies on the rise and large companies doing well. You won’t find this mix in Europe, which suffers from a shortage of small companies. We have so many success stories to choose from that our list could have run several pages.
It was difficult to narrow our list to twenty-five. Many other heroes at other great companies were left out. We could easily have picked 250 small companies that hit the big time in the last twenty years, along with one hundred large companies that kept going or turned themselves around.
We also could have packed our list with all-stars of software, computing, and electronics (Cisco, Sun Microsystems, and Micron Technology) and the performance of our twenty-five small companies would look even better. But we tried to get a sampling from different industries to show that companies of all kinds can grow fast in America. We’ve included a toy company, a payroll processor, an airline, even a company that makes the “carbon black” that’s used to strengthen tires. That’s Cabot. Cabot went through a difficult period, but turned itself around. It’s the only turnaround among the twenty-five.
The heroes list gives you one more example of how you can make money investing in big companies or in small companies, but if you specialize in small companies, you could do amazingly well. Among our big companies there are three ten-baggers in which investors could have made ten times their money—Fannie Mae, Gillette, and Coca-Cola. In the 1985–95 period, among the small companies, there are six ten-baggers, three twenty-five-baggers, and three forty- to fifty-baggers. You’ve got Amgen up from $1.36 to $84, Oracle up from $0.83 to $42, and Compaq up from $1.69 to $50. Those are impressive moves.
You can see why you don’t need to be right all the time to make money in stocks. Let’s say you own ten small companies and three of them go from $40 million in sales to zero, and their stocks go from $20 a share to zero. These losses will be more than offset by one big winner that goes from $40 million in sales to $800 million, sending its stock price soaring from $20 a share to $400 a share.
The dynamic process of new companies’ going public continues at a heady pace. From 1993 through mid-1995, more than seventeen hundred new stocks have made their debut. Investors have risked $100 billion on these fledglings. Some will be flops, but among these seventeen hundred you will find the next Amgen, the next Staples, the next Home Depot.
